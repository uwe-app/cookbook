## Build Tools

The frontend ecosystem is very diverse so we cannot support the myriad tools that people like to use but this repository includes examples of using some of the most popular build tools with [UWE][].

For the best performance compiling Javascript/Typescript we recommend using the [swc](/swc) integration.

See the [documentation][docs] for more information.

## Run

To test any of the integrations, clone this repository and change into the directory containing the project. If it has a `package.json` file run `yarn install` then you can preview the site with live reload:

```
uwe dev --exec
```

To test a production build (equivalent to `NODE_ENV=production`) run:

```
uwe server --exec --open
```

Each build tool should show a check mark if it is working, for example, if you launch the [swc](/swc) project with `uwe dev --exec` you should expect to see on the web page:

```text
swc âœ“
```

## Test

To run a smoke test of all the integrations:

```
make test
```

## Notes

Tested using node@14.3.0.
